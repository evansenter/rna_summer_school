In this morning lecture we will provide an introduction to Algorithms for students without a computer science background. This lecture will introduce the concept of algorithm and review some of the most relevant types of algorithms. Also, a brief introduction to the graph formalism and some relevant problems associated will be presented. After the break, we will introduce a discussion of the difficulty of certain types of problems along with a review of optimization techniques such as approximation algorithms, local search and constraint programming. A tentative outline is:
1. Introduction
2. Algorithm Analysis
3. Graphs
4. Greedy Algorithms
5. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
6. Dynamic Programming
7. Intractability
8. Approximation Algorithms
9. Local Search
10. Constraint Programming
