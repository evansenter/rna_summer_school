Many aspects of a cellâ€™s complex biology are regulated at the level of RNA-based processes. Through an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying this regulation, it is becoming increasingly straightforward to manipulate biological systems using these principles. Additionally, by using selection strategies, the design of new RNA-based solutions that operate either independently of or concertedly with host cell regulatory components is now attainable. These advances provide opportunities to further our understanding of basic regulatory mechanisms, in addition to creating novel tools for synthetic biology applications. Here, we illustrate the de novo design of an orthogonally-controlled, synthetic RNA-protein switch that can be used to regulate translation in both model and pathogenic eukaryotic organisms. Additionally, we demonstrate engineering its functional integration with the native host cell translation regulatory machinery to achieve substantially enhanced dynamic range and robust control of translation. Finally, we highlight a framework for using this synthetic switch as a functional genetics tool to study the human malaria pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum.
