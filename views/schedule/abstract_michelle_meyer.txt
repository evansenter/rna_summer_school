Goals:
    - Why do we care about RNA?
    - What does RNA do in biological systems (focused on bacterial systems)? How does the biochemistry of RNA contribute to these roles?

Part I
1) Classical roles of RNA
    - rRNA
    - mRNA
    - tRNA
2) RNA as a regulator (focused on bacterial RNAs)
    - regulating transcription (attenuation)
    - regulating translation
    - riboswitches
    - ribosomal protein leader sequences
    - sRNAs

Part II
1) RNA biochemistry
    - RNA chemistry
    - Forces involved in folding RNA
    - RNA secondary structure
    - RNA tertiary structure
2) RNA as a catalyst
    - RNA catalyzed chemistry
    -biological relevance of ribozymes
    - RNA world

Applications: Engineering RNA
