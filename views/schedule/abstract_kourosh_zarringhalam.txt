Statistical learning is comprised of a set of tools and models for understanding complex data sets. These tools are generally classified into supervised or unsupervised learning. The task in supervised learning is to predict or estimate the output based on a set of input features. This talk will provide an overview of some of the models that are used in supervised learning, such as classification and regression models as well as regularization techniques. The applications of such models in analyzing gene expression patterns and discovery of transcriptional biomarkers will be presented. The talk will conclude with a discussion on generalizability of these models and their potential extensions.
