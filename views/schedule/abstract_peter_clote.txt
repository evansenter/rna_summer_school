This algorithms talk will cover background material on dynamic programming secon
dary structure prediction and RNA kinetics, as well as results from our lab.

Background material
1) Nussinov-Jacobson dynamic programming algorithm for secondary structure; partition function computation, sampling RNA secondary structures
2) Turner energy model: Zuker algorithm, McCaskill algorithm
3) Context free grammars, relation between combinatorics and partition function
4) Pseudoknotted structures
5) Kinetics fundamentals: mean first passage time and master equation

Results from our lab
1) Secondary structure prediction that incorporates chemical/enzymatic probing d
ata
2) Applications of RNA inverse folding using constraint programming3) Design/application of thermodynamics-based RNA algorithms: expected 5'-3' distance, page number of pseudoknotted structures, RNA segmentation, Wang-Landau sa
mpling (due to time, only some of these topics may be covered).
