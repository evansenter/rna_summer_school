Background material
-------------------
1) Nussinov-Jacobson dynamic programming algorithm for secondary structure; partition function computation, sampling RNA secondary structures
2) Turner energy model: Zuker algorithm, McCaskill algorithm
3) Context free grammars, relation between combinatorics and partition function
4) Pseudoknotted structures
5) Kinetics fundamentals: mean first passage time and master equation

Results from our lab
--------------------
1) Secondary structure prediction that incorporates chemical/enzymatic probing data
2) Applications of RNA inverse folding using constraint programming
3) Design/application of thermodynamics-based RNA algorithms: RNAbor/FFTbor, expected 5'-3' distance, page number of pseudoknotted structures, RNA segmentation, Wang-Landau sampling (due to time, only some of these topics may be covered).
