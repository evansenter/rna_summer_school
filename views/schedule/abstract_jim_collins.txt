Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers, physicists and biologists to model, design and construct biological circuits out of RNA, proteins, genes and other bits of DNA, and to use these circuits to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms are going to change our lives in the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, rapid diagnostic tests, and targeted therapies to attack "superbugs". In this talk, we highlight recent efforts to create RNA-based circuits and programmable cells, and discuss a variety of synthetic biology applications in biocomputing, biotechnology and biomedicine. Additionally, we present integrated computational-experimental approaches that enable construction of quantitative models of regulatory networks using RNA-based expression measurements and no prior information on the network structure or function. We discuss how the reverse-engineered network models, coupled to experiments, can be used: (1) to gain insight into the regulatory role of individual genes and proteins in the network, (2) to identify the pathways and gene products targeted by pharmaceutical compounds, and (3) to identify the genetic mediators of different diseases.
